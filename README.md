# Paddy Leaf Disease Prediction 🌾🧠

This project focuses on **automatic detection and classification of paddy leaf diseases** using **Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques**. The objective is to assist farmers, researchers, and agricultural practitioners by providing an AI-driven solution for early disease identification from paddy leaf images.

The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and transfer learning-based architectures to classify images into different disease categories.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Paddy crops are highly vulnerable to various leaf diseases that can significantly reduce crop yield if not detected at an early stage. Traditional manual inspection is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires domain expertise.

This project aims to:
- Automate disease detection using paddy leaf images
- Reduce dependency on manual diagnosis
- Provide fast and reliable predictions using deep learning models
